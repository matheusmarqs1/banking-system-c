## 💡 Description
A simple **banking system** implemented in the C language, simulating the main functionalities of a modern bank application.  
The system allows users to **create, access, and manage bank accounts**, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.

The project was designed to reinforce concepts of **pointers, dynamic memory, and linked lists**, focusing on efficiency and data integrity.

## ⚙️ Features
- Create and delete accounts  
- Authenticate using CPF and password  
- Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers  
- Check account balance  
- Manage dynamic data using **linked lists**

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Pointer manipulation and memory management in C  
- Modular programming and separation of concerns  
- Implementation of dynamic data structures (linked lists)  
- Team collaboration and version control practices
